## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
- This project was challenging as I had to spend some time to think about the correct HTML tag to use for each container to make the page as semantically correct as possible.
- In addition to that, I learned how to style the numbers in an ordered list using the ```::marker``` pseudo-element and I also used a bullet point svg instead of the standard bullet point in an unordered list by using the ```background-image``` and ```background-position``` properties.
